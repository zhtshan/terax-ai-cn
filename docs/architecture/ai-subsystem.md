# AI subsystem

This guide elaborates on `TERAX.md`. If anything here conflicts with `TERAX.md`, `TERAX.md` wins.

## Overview

The AI subsystem is BYOK (bring your own key). It supports cloud providers via `@ai-sdk/*` and local / offline providers via OpenAI-compatible endpoints. The agent layer is built on Vercel AI SDK v6 chat semantics: `streamText`, tool definitions, and `stopWhen` step limits.

Main entry point: `runAgentStream` in `src/modules/ai/lib/agent.ts`.

## Providers

Cloud providers are defined in `src/modules/ai/config.ts`:

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Cerebras, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter
- `openai-compatible` for any custom base URL
- Local: LM Studio, MLX, Ollama

`buildLanguageModel` in `src/modules/ai/lib/agent.ts:76` branches on `provider` to construct the correct AI SDK provider instance. Local providers use `createOpenAICompatible` with a `localProxyFetch` that allows private-network access, while cloud providers use their dedicated SDK constructors.

Model metadata (context limits, costs, reasoning behavior) lives in the model registry in `config.ts`. `resolveModel` maps a model id to its provider and defaults.

### Adding a new provider

1. Add a `ProviderInfo` entry to `PROVIDERS` in `src/modules/ai/config.ts`.
2. Add model ids and metadata to the model registry in the same file.
3. Add a branch in `buildLanguageModel` (`src/modules/ai/lib/agent.ts:99`) that constructs the provider instance. For OpenAI-compatible APIs you can often reuse `createOpenAICompatible`.
4. If the provider requires an API key, update `providerNeedsKey` in `config.ts` and the keyring service mapping.
5. If it needs a dedicated `@ai-sdk/*` package, add it to `package.json` and justify the bundle cost (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
6. New built-ins must justify unique value beyond `openai-compatible` and OpenRouter; `CONTRIBUTING.md` calls this out explicitly.

Keys are never persisted outside the OS keychain / Linux secrets file.

## Agent run loop

`runAgentStream` (`agent.ts:391`):

1. Resolves the model via `buildConfiguredLanguageModel`.
2. Builds a stable system prompt from `selectSystemPrompt(modelId)` plus optional persona, custom instructions, and `TERAX.md` project memory.
3. Converts UI messages to model messages, prunes reasoning content if the model does not keep it, and compacts old messages if the context limit is exceeded.
4. Streams via `streamText` with the tool set from `buildTools(ctx)` and `stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_AGENT_STEPS)`.
5. Emits step labels, usage deltas, and finish metadata.

The tool set is assembled in `src/modules/ai/tools/tools.ts` from `fs`, `edit`, `search`, `shell`, `subagent`, `terminal`, `todo`, and `managedAgent` builders.

## Sub-agents

`src/modules/ai/agents/registry.ts` defines read-only sub-agents: `explore`, `code-review`, `security`, and `general`. Each has a whitelist of tools and its own system prompt. `run_subagent` cannot recurse (the subagent tool set excludes `run_subagent` itself).

## Sessions

Conversations are organized into sessions. Persistence lives in `terax-ai-sessions.json` via `tauri-plugin-store` (`src/modules/ai/lib/sessions.ts`):

- `sessions` key: list of session metadata
- `activeId` key: active session id
- `messages:<id>` keys: per-session messages, loaded lazily

`AgentRunBridge` mirrors active-session messages to disk on every change and auto-derives titles from the first user message.

## Composer

`AiComposerProvider` (`src/modules/ai/lib/composer.tsx`) is a React context that holds shared input state (text, attachments, voice) for the docked input bar and any other surface. Attachments can be images, text files, or `selection` chips from the terminal or editor. Selections are wrapped as `<selection source="terminal|editor">…</selection>` blocks at submit time and are not pasted into the textarea.

The composer derives `isBusy` from `agentMeta.status` so it can mount safely before sessions hydrate.

## Tools and approval

Tool definitions live under `src/modules/ai/tools/`:

- Read-only tools (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `grep`, `glob`) auto-execute after passing the security deny-list.
- Mutating tools (`write_file`, `edit`, `multi_edit`, `create_directory`, `bash_run`, `bash_background`) set `needsApproval: true`. The AI SDK pauses and the UI renders an approval card.
- `edit` / `multi_edit` enforce a read-before-edit invariant: the model must have read the file earlier in the session.
- In plan mode, mutating tools queue edits for batch review instead of applying them immediately.

Auto-send after approval uses `lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses`.

## Edit diffs

AI-proposed file edits open in an `ai-diff` tab. The user accepts or rejects per hunk. Only after acceptance does the `write_file` or `edit` tool actually run. This keeps the approval UI decoupled from the tool execution.

## Live context bridge

`App.tsx` calls `setLive({ getCwd, getTerminalContext, … })` so tools can read the currently active terminal's cwd and the last 300 lines of buffer. It is lazy by design - tools call for it only when needed rather than pre-snapshotting every turn.

## Invariants

- Keep the Vercel AI SDK v6 chat shape (`streamText`, tools, step limits); the rest of the UI depends on it.
- Keys only via `secrets_*` commands; never disk, settings store, or `localStorage`.
- New providers must justify their bundle cost and unique value.
- Mutating tools require approval; read-only tools still pass the deny-list.
